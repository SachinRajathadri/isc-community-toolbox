<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

<!-- <div align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/idn-community-toolbox-output.png" width="500" height="" style="text-align:center">
</div> -->

The Identity Security Cloud Community Toolbox is a desktop application you can use to administer and troubleshoot IdentityNow. The Community Toolbox is built using Electron and Sveltekit, and it is developed and maintained by the SailPoint Developer Relations team. 

The goal of the Community Toolbox is to provide a single place to perform common administrative tasks and troubleshoot issues in your IdentityNow tenant.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Get started

To use this tool, you will need to have an IdentityNow tenant.

Pick your OS and download the relevant file from the latest release:
| Platform | File Type |

### Build the application from source

Prerequisites:
* To build the application from source you will need NPM installed. You can find instructions on how to install NPM [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once you have NPM installed, you can clone this repository and run the following commands in the specified order and folders:

Go to the folder: `./Sveltekit-App`
First, run this command:
```bash
npm install
```

Then run this command:
```bash
npm run build
```

Next, go to the folder: `./Electron-App`
First, run this command: 
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run this command:
```bash
npm run build
```

As long as there are no errors during the build process, the built application binaries will then be located in the `./Electron-App/out` folder.
